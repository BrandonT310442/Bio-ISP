      </h1>
      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Dumbo octopuses will reproduce sexually. Furthermore, males will fertilize the eggs of females. Dumbo octopuses tend to reproduce just above the sea floor. Males will use a modified arm called a hectocotylus to deposit sperm packets called spermatophores into the female's mantle cavity. Because dumbo octopuses are so uncommon, they frequently exhibit a specialized behaviour that increases their likelihood of reproducing when they come across a mate. Additionally, Female dumbo octopuses can transfer the male gametes to their eggs whenever they want due to their extraordinary capacity to store sperm for lengthy periods. When fertilization occurs, the female will lay the eggs in a cluster formation (Figure 1.1). Dumbo octopus eggs tend to be big for an octopus, often being several millimetres in diameter. Since there are many sea creatures that threaten dumbo octopuses, the dumbo octopus will guard its eggs and aerate them by fanning them with its tentacles. The eggs take several months to develop, and once they have hatched, they will turn into planktonic larvae and eventually develop into baby dumbo octopuses. Just like humans, dumbo octopuses pass genetic information through their offspring. The parents contribute half of their genetic makeup to the offspring, which creates a unique dumbo octopus. As a result, the offspring also inherit traits that contribute to its physical appearance and may also inherit other traits such as diseases or conditions (MarineBio, n.d.). </p>

      </h1>
      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The dumbo octopus also has a unique feature that many animals do not have: RNA (Ribonucleic acid) editing. Approximately half of the RNA found in dumbo octopuses experience RNA editing. To provide a better understanding, out of the 20,000 genes that humans have, only a dozen are used for RNA editing. In terms of octopuses, RNA is vital as it aids in the process of the synthesis of proteins. Interestingly, a new report published in Cell Reports found that octopuses modify their RNA very frequently. Specifically, the dumbo octopus is known to have a type of RNA editing called adenosine to inosine. This process converts adenosine bases to inosine bases. By changing the way that ion channels work in nerve cells and having a particular impact on the control of calcium ions entering nerve cells, this kind of RNA editing aids in regulating the nervous system. The release of neurotransmitters and the potency of nerve impulses can both be influenced by its ability to regulate ion flow. However, the downside is that this may ultimately impact the transmission of nerve impulses. The dumbo octopus would not need to edit its RNA this frequently to regulate its nervous system. As a result, scientists are still not sure why octopuses edit their RNA so often, but it is thought that it is related to their adaptations to the deep sea environment. Dumbo octopuses have large body sizes, low metabolic rates and slower movements compared to other octopuses, which can be attributed to low food and energy in the deep sea. Ultimately, RNA editing in the nervous system could allow such adaptability (Stetka, 2017) . </p>
