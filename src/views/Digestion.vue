      <h1 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">Path of The Digestion System
      </h1>
      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The digestive system of an octopus allows them to consume and store nutrients that provide them with energy. The digestive system starts with the buccal mass, which consists of its chitinous beak, mouth, pharynx, salivary glands and radula. An octopus captures its prey with its tentacles and brings it to its mouth. Dumbo octopuses contain eight lips, and the mouth is located below its arms. Each of the lips has small teeth, which allow them to break down their prey. This row of teeth is called the radula, and it also contains a firm muscular tongue which aids them in digestion. After the food is in the mouth, it passes through the chitinous beak, a complex structure resembling a parrot's beak (4.1). This beak is used to break down food into smaller pieces further. The food then passes through the esophagus, which contains saliva and salivary glands similar to humans. Enzymes within the saliva, such as trypsin and serotonin (which are also found in humans) help break down the food chemically. After the food goes through the esophagus, it ends up in the stomach, where digestive enzymes within the stomach help to break down the food even further. The killing of bacteria also occurs here. The stomach acid pH level falls within the range of 3-6, creating a hostile environment for the food. The food subsequently passes through to the cecum, a small sac-like structure near the stomach. Additional digestive enzymes and bacteria are present in the cecum to assist in further food breakdown. After the cecum, the food traverses into the intestine, where it is broken down into smaller molecules and its nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream. Octopuses have a long and convoluted intestines. This allows for maximum absorption. Any extra waste that is not absorbed into the bloodstream is eliminated from the body through the anus (Wells, n.d.). </p>

      </h1>
      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Dumbo octopuses are considered opportunistic predators, meaning they will consume any food they can find. When hunting, they tend to hide and lay beneath rocks or other hiding places due to their small size. If no hiding place is available for the dumbo octopus, it tends to blend in with the dark seafloor by using its ink and body. As prey comes by, they reach out with their tentacles and pull the animal back into its hiding place. Dumbo octopuses eat a vast range of different types of food; however, they primarily feed on small crustaceans and mollusks. One of the most common foods it eats is shrimp. Dumbo octopuses love to eat shrimp since they are nutritious and an excellent energy source. Since dumbo octopuses are constantly on the move, they frequently require a source of energy. Additionally, shrimps are relatively small, making it easy for the dumbo octopus to eat. Another food which dumbo octopuses like to eat is cuttlefish. Dumbo octopuses are predators who will consume any food they can find. However, cuttlefish predominantly make up a significant portion of their diet. They tend to enjoy cuttlefish because they are slow creatures, allowing them to obtain and devour them. Another creature that makes up a significant portion of the dumbo octopus diet is krill. Krill are tiny creatures that most resemble shrimp. Since it is small, the dumbo octopus can quickly suck them into their mouths. Krill's are rich in omega-3 fatty acids. These fatty acids allow for the dumbo octopus skin and eyes to remain healthy. It is crucial for them to constantly keep their eyes healthy as they are known to have bad eyesight's. Luckily, there is no shortage of these animals in the ocean, so the dumbo octopus tends to have an ample supply of food within the ocean (Hossain, 2022).  </p>
