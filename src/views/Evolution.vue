      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The evolutionary history of the dumbo octopus cannot be determined explicitly due to them living at great depths, preventing fossils from being found. Hence, this section will only focus on the evolutionary history of the octopus. The history of the octopus can be traced back to over 530 million years ago. At this time, octopuses evolved from the group of animals called Mollusca. Mollusca is a soft-bodied invertebrate animal. The group of animals classified under Mollusca includes snails, clams and squids. Around 500 million years ago, a group of mollusks (including octopuses), the earliest cephalopods, began to evolve. However, these early generations of the octopus were relatively small and had external shells which protected their soft bodies. Although many developed external shells, some developed internal shells that would be similar to those that are found in nautiluses. The first modern octopuses without shells appeared in fossil records over 296 million years ago. These octopuses were tiny and were around the size of a human's thumb. Despite how small they were, they did have rudimentary suckers and arms. During the Jurassic period, around 201 to 145 million years ago, octopuses grew significantly. Fossil records of an octopus-like animal, Pholsepia, have been found and are estimated to be around 5 feet long. Like the modern octopus, this creature had a similar body shape but a smaller internal shell. Then a few million years after, octopuses with these internal shells began to disappear from records of fossils. Due to this, many scientists have thought they may have gone extinct due to competition. However, the octopuses seen in our oceans today evolved from an ancestor more than 30 million years ago. Moreover, throughout millions of years, these octopuses developed unique features that set them apart from their ancestors. One of these features that was developed was a complex nervous system, which includes a centralized brain. This set octopuses apart from their relatives and other related animals, allowing them to be significantly smarter and more intelligent. Additionally, over this period, octopuses could develop the ability to change colour and texture to blend in with their environment. This is accomplished through specialized muscles and chromatophores on their skin. Overall, the evolutionary history of the octopus is long from Mollusca to well-developed creatures; it is evident that octopuses are a testament to the power of evolution and adaptation (Kr√∂ger et al., 2011).  </p>
