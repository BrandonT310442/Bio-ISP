      </h1>
      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The dumbo octopus faces several challenges, such as temperature, water pressure and food availability. In order to overcome these challenges, the dumbo octopus developed several adaptations. One adaptation that is visible on the dumbo octopus is its body shape. Unlike many other octopuses with a much longer, narrow and streamlined body shape, the dumbo octopus has a round, bulky body. They also have two large fins resembling the Disney character dumbo, where they get their name. Overall, the two large fins and their body shape allow the dumbo octopus to move through water with greater efficiency, ultimately conserving energy and helping them navigate through dark environments of the deep sea (Sil, 2022) . </p>
     <br>
     <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The dumbo octopus is also extremely good at regulating its buoyancy. To regulate their buoyancy, they have an astonishing amount of control regarding the amount of gas that enters their internal chambers. By controlling this amount of gas, they can either rise or sink in the water column. This adaptation is critical since the pressure in the deep sea is so significantly higher than that of the surface that rising too quickly can cause internal damage to the organs. This is why scientists have had trouble obtaining a dumbo octopus that is alive. Regulating buoyancy also allows them to conserve energy and avoid unnecessary movements that could attract predators (Pacific, n.d.). </p>
      <br>
      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Dumbo octopuses have also developed their senses which help them survive in their environment. Although their eyesight is not the greatest, their eyes are extremely sensitive, allowing them to see in the dark, and their perfect sense allows them to locate their prey. They also tend to have a good touch, which is vital since they often navigate through rocky terrain on the sea floor (Sil, 2022). </p>

      <br>
      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">In terms of variation, dumbo octopuses have many variations, which allows them to quickly adapt to changing environmental conditions. Many studies have shown that different populations of dumbo octopus exhibit different and distinct genetic markers. This indicates that they had most likely undergone microevolution and have evolved different adaptations to their local environments. An example of this variation can be seen through their body and fin sizes between dumbo octopuses living in different parts of the ocean. It has been shown that dumbo octopuses that live in warmer waters tend to be significantly smaller and have shorter fins. This is because it allows them to conserve energy in warmer temperatures. Conversely, dumbo octopuses that live in much colder temperatures tend to be larger and have longer fins, allowing them to move more effectively through much denser water (Harvey, n.d.). </p>
