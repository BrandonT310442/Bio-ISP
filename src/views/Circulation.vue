      </h1>
      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The dumbo octopus has three hearts and a closed circulatory system. One of the three hearts is called a systemic heart, which helps circulate blood throughout the body. The two other hearts, called branchial hearts, circulate blood through each of the two gills. As stated before, the gills are responsible for gas exchange from the water that passes over them. As a result, the blood that flows through the octopus's gills picks up oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide. After the blood becomes oxygenated in the gills, it gets pumped through the arteries to the rest of the body. The primary function of the arteries is to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the organs and tissues of the octopus. After the oxygen and nutrients are delivered to the organs and tissues, the blood returns to the heart through the veins, and the cycle repeats. The octopus has two organs/structures in which waste is removed. The first is the kidneys. The octopus has two kidneys responsible for filtering waste products from the blood. These kidney-like structures, called nephridia, help eliminate waste, such as ammonia, produced from digesting and breaking down proteins (Vedantu, n.d.). </p>
     <br>
     <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Another structure within the octopus that is responsible for eliminating waste products is the siphon. The siphon is an opening in the body; its primary function is to serve as a water pathway. However, the siphon is also used to breathe, defend, feed, and expel waste. For defence, it expels an inky fluid that darkens the water, making it hard for predators to see them. This fluid also contains a substance that prevents predators from smelling them, making it harder for predators to track the octopus. The siphon will expel waste products in a long noodle-like strands. This strand still contains nutrients so many other animals tend to feed off this strand (Monterey Bay Aquarium, 2021).    </p>
