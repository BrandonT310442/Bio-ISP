      </h1>
      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Due to their extensive nervous system, octopuses typically require more oxygen than fish and other aquatic mollusks (Kate Douglas, n.d.). They have nine brains, and it is well known that brain tissues consistently require large amounts of oxygen to supply energy (Kate Douglas, n.d.). 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>The respiration process of the octopus starts at the gills. Octopuses breathe through gills which are located in the mantle cavity. Water enters the octopus' gills as it enters its mouth. The gills will filter the water to remove the oxygen before being returned to the ocean. The gills are made of a feathery filament, which allows for a larger surface area. This large surface area allows the octopus to pick up more oxygen per breath. The oxygen is then picked up in the capillaries (located in the gills) in a process called counter-current exchange. This process will only allow oxygen to be picked up in the capillaries, only if the amount of oxygen in the blood is lower than in the water. The octopus uses this process as it allows for the continuous exchange of oxygen between the blood and water. Furthermore, the blood will travel in the opposite direction in the gills than the direction the water travels to allow for maximum gas exchange for each breath (as shown in figure 2.1). Because the muscular system of the octopus allows for the contraction of the mantle cavity, it will ultimately force oxygenated water across the filaments of the gills. Thus, it can achieve an 11% saturation level in its blood. In comparison, fish and mollusks can only attain an average of 3% oxygen saturation within their blood. </p>

      </h1>
      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">All octopuses have three hearts. As stated previously, two of the three hearts are used to pump blood through the gills where gas exchange occurs. The blood, which leaves the gills, is now oxygenated and will return to the third heart to be pumped through the rest of the body for various cellular functions. In humans, oxygen is carried in a protein called hemoglobin, however in octopuses, they use a different protein called hemocyanin. Hemocyanin is dissolved in plasma which causes the blood of an octopus to be blue (Figure 2.2). The main difference between hemocyanin and hemoglobin is that hemocyanin contains copper instead of iron. This difference causes hemocyanin not to be directly bounded to red blood cells like hemoglobin. Instead, hemocyanin is suspended within the hemolymph and transports oxygen throughout the body through this process. One concern for aquatic animals such as octopuses is the amount of oxygen in the water. As climate change worsens, so does the temperature of the water. The temperature of water affects the degree of dissolution (solubility). As temperature increases, the solubility of gas solutes decreases. Furthermore, if the temperature were to increase, the amount of aqueous oxygen in the water would decrease because of solubility decreasing. The solubility would decrease because gas molecules are more likely to become gas instead of aqueous as they speed up. This in turn, will cause less oxygen in the water, leading to suffocating octopuses due to lack of oxygen (Kate Douglas, n.d.).  </p>
